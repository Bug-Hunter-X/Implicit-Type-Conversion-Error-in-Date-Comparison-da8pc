To fix this, explicitly convert the `VARCHAR` value to a `DATE` using the `CAST` or `CONVERT` function before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is performed between two values of the same data type and prevents the implicit conversion from introducing errors.  For example, if '2024-03-15' is the value in `VARCHAR` column, it should be converted to a `DATE` before comparing it to the `date_column`. The corrected SQL query is given below:

```sql
SELECT * FROM your_table
WHERE date_column = CAST('2024-03-15' AS DATE);
```

Alternatively, you can use CONVERT:

```sql
SELECT * FROM your_table
WHERE date_column = CONVERT(DATE, '2024-03-15', 120); -- style 120 is yyyy-mm-dd
```

Remember to choose the appropriate style code for `CONVERT` based on your date format.  Always validate input data and apply appropriate type handling to maintain the correctness and reliability of SQL queries.
