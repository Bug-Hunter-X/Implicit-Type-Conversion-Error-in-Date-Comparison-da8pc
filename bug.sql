The SQL query contains a subtle error related to implicit type conversion.  The `date_column` is of type `DATE`, but the value being compared is a `VARCHAR`.  SQL Server performs implicit conversion, but this can lead to unexpected results, especially with date formats. In this case, the conversion might fail or produce incorrect results, leading to inaccurate query output. For instance, if the `VARCHAR` value has an incorrect date format, the comparison will not function as intended.
