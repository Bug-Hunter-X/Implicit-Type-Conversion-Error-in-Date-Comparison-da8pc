This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle error in SQL queries involving implicit type conversion of dates. The bug showcases how comparing a `DATE` column with a `VARCHAR` value can lead to unexpected and incorrect query results due to implicit type coercion.  The solution provides a corrected version of the query, emphasizing the importance of explicit type casting for robust date comparisons.  Always ensure type consistency when working with dates to prevent these kinds of issues.
